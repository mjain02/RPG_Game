RPG game

A role-playing game developed on an Mbed controller using C and C++ programming languages. 

Players must complete a quest by accomplishing tasks such as collecting objects and interacting with non-player characters.

An accelerometer and push buttons are used to accept inputs from the player, and they determine the player's movements and actions throughout the game.
